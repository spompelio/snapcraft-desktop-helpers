# Snapcraft Desktop Helpers

Fork of https://github.com/ubuntu/snapcraft-desktop-helpers with the ability to use Qt 5.12 from a PPA.  

You may install from one of the Qt 5.12.X PPAs such as https://launchpad.net/~beineri/+archive/ubuntu/opt-qt-5.12.6-bionic first.  The qmake plugin was extended to qmakeppa and uses some hardcoded paths from the PPA.

A QML application demo was added along with an example for pulling in a qmake CONFIG option.  

This has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04
